Hi everyone, we finished stage 1 of the build, kind of. 
I'm getting pretty burned out at looking at the same thing 
over and over so I decided to move on. All the planned 
features are present, but not in the pristine way I was 
hoping to make them. Either way, It just means we are 
making our way to stage 2 (Stages and Phases are just how 
I organized what I need to get done.)

So, I'm getting annoyed with serialization at the moment. 
It was working near perfectly for the browser until I somehow 
broke it, I don't know how though. Right now, SQL is starting 
to look more appealing to me as I struggle with the current 
system. Though, I haven't decided if I want to store the databases 
locally or on a network and when should I do it.

Moving on now, I'm going to move onto stage 2 which is a 
shorter one that includes some PC power control features and 
some quick actions that might be useful. I might also start 
working on Auxy and making him some basic functions.
