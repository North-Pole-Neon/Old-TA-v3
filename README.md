# Welcome to Tigris Auxilium

Tigris Auxilium is soon to be your new personal assist. ```Tigris Auxilium (TA)``` is a work in progress project that is supposed to help students with daily tasks that might not be easly assessable.

You can get the latest version of TA [here](https://github.com/North-Pole-Neon/Tigris-Auxilium/releases/tag/v0.0.2.0). Also, you can find instalation instructions below for help.



## Instalation Instruction

You will need either a JDK or JRE to run the application. TA is written in Java 11, so I recommend [```Amazon Corretto 11```](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html) which can be found online or depending on devices, ```Self Service``` should provide you with the download. If you're installing Corretto from the website, you can go to either the [Windows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/windows-7-install.html) or [macOS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/macos-install.html) guides to help you. Then you should be able to open it like any other application. If you wish to import it into an ```IDE``` like [```Eclipse```](https://www.eclipse.org/), you can follow a guide on importing like this [guide](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~kaharris/10200/tutorials/eclipse/import.html).

For right now, until I get to a certain point of development where I see the TA as ready, I will keep releases in a jar file. I will start to add more formats to the releases once I've gotten to the point.

### Steps:

1. Download and install a Java ```JRE/JDK``` (Recommended ```Amazon Corretto 11```)
2. Download [```Jar```](https://github.com/North-Pole-Neon/Tigris-Auxilium/releases) file
3. Go to ```terminal```
4. Type ```Java -version``` and press enter. If you don't get an error than Java is installed properly
5. To open application click on the jar file and it should boot properly
6. If it doesnt boot or give error go back to terminal
7. Type ```java -jar Filname.jar```. (Change ```Filename.jar``` to the name of your jar file, or just drag and drop)
8. Enjoy
