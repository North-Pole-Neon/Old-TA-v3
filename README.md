# Welcome to Tigris Auxilium

Tigris Auxilium is soon to be your go to app. ```Tigris Auxilium (TA)``` is a work in progress project built in Java with Swing, that is supposed to help students with daily tasks that might not have an easy alternative.

TA is built with certain features in mind for Shakopee high school students (SHS). So some features may not apply or are helpful to you. Everyone is welcomed to test and contribute, but I target SHS students.

You can get the latest version of TA [here](https://github.com/North-Pole-Neon/Tigris-Auxilium/releases/tag/v0.0.2.0). Also, you can find instalation instructions below for help.

# UPDATE:

Due to recent changes, I decided to move from Java Swing to JavaFX. I will no longer be working or updating this project anymore. The new repo will be developed on my account rather than the organizations. The main reason why I made a new repo instead of creating a new branch was that I would've been way more work to rebuild, so it was easier to start from scratch. Once I port all the current features of TAv3 to TAv4 I will move it to the organization's page.



# Instalation Instruction

You will need either a JDK or JRE to run the application. TA is written in Java 11, so I recommend [```Amazon Corretto 11```](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html) which can be found online or depending on devices, ```Self Service``` should provide you with the download. If you're installing Corretto from the website, you can go to either the [Windows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/windows-7-install.html) or [macOS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/macos-install.html) guides to help you. Then you should be able to open it like any other application. If you wish to import it into an ```IDE``` like [```Eclipse```](https://www.eclipse.org/), you can follow a guide on importing like this [guide](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~kaharris/10200/tutorials/eclipse/import.html).


## Steps:

### Installing Java:
1. Download and install a Java ```JRE/JDK``` (Recommended ```Amazon Corretto 11```)
2. Download [```Jar```](https://github.com/North-Pole-Neon/Tigris-Auxilium/releases) file
3. Go to ```terminal```
4. Type ```Java -version``` and press enter. If you don't get an error than Java is installed properly

### Opening the jar
1. To open the application, click on the jar file, then it should boot properly
2. If it doesn't boot or gives an error, go back to the terminal
3. Type ```java -jar Filname.jar```. (Change ```Filename.jar``` to the name of your jar file, or just drag and drop)
4. Enjoy
